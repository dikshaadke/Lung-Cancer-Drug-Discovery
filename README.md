# Lung-Cancer-Drug-Discovery
This repository is a part of learning application of data mining for lung cancer drug discovery. 
Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) being the most prevalent type. While conventional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery have demonstrated efficacy, their associated adverse effects have prompted the exploration of alternative lung cancer therapies, including novel drugs. Notably, the aberrant activation of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) protein is a crucial driver of lung cancer. In this project, we aim to evaluate the performance of various regression algorithms, namely Random Forest Regressor, Ada-boost Regressor, and Bagging Regressor, in predicting the efficacy of a drug in inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells harboring EGFR protein defects.
